Getting Started

Selenium-Ruby bundles the selenium server and Ruby classes in the gem so that you can use them right away.

h1. Selenium Server

Selenium-ruby installs the executable at the ruby/bin directory so you can launch the server through command:

<div class="Shaded">
<pre>selenium</pre>
</div>

h1. Selenium RC

You can use Selenium RC that is installed as a gem, so that your existing action based web testing still works.  The following
example is using "RSpec":http://rspec.rubyforge.org:

<template:code source="../spec/selenium/tc_interaction_example.rb" tag="INTERACTION" syntax="ruby"/>

h1. Selenium Ruby

You can use classes that come with Selenium ruby to write object based web testing.

<template:code source="../spec/selenium/tc_domain_example.rb" tag="DOMAIN" syntax="ruby"/>

The class that described Google home page is defined as following

<template:code source="../spec/selenium/tc_domain_example.rb" tag="GOOGLEHOME" syntax="ruby"/>
